**Meeting Type:** Mentor / Project Workshop

## Agenda

- Introductions and students’ career aspirations​
- Understand project context, problems, and business goals​
- Review functional and non-functional requirements​
- Discuss agile concepts, BA role, and Scrum ceremonies​
- Identify stakeholders and plan stakeholder mapping exercise

## Discussion Summary

- Students and mentor introduced themselves, shared academic background and interest in software engineering or related careers.​

- Team explained curriculum requirement to complete an industry-style project, leading to their asset management idea for IT companies.​

- Business problems identified: weak asset tracking, unmanaged software licenses/subscriptions, and difficulty understanding asset-related costs and depreciation.​

- Proposed solution: unified asset management system for software and hardware, with integration to existing tools (e.g., ticketing system) and possible APIs for finance.​

- Functional requirements discussed, including asset registry, tracking, notifications, cost analysis, filtering, categorization, and roles.​

- Non-functional requirements highlighted: security, usability, reliability/maintainability, and performance.​

- Mentor explained agile vs waterfall, iterations, “workable product” each sprint, and BA responsibilities in Scrum ceremonies and backlog grooming.​

- Emphasis was placed on understanding and communicating business value, not only technical requirements.​

- Stakeholder identification and stakeholder map (power/interest grid) were introduced as a key exercise for prioritizing requirements.​

- Students were encouraged to think about both internal (IT, management, finance, users) and potential external stakeholders (other client companies, legal/compliance).

## Decisions

- Proceed with a combined hardware and software asset management solution targeting IT companies.​

- Integrate with existing systems (e.g., ticketing, future finance access via APIs) rather than rebuilding everything.​

- Use stakeholder mapping (power/interest grid) to guide requirement prioritization.​

- Future sessions will focus on practical agile/BA work (requirements, stakeholders, user stories) instead of purely theoretical lectures.​
